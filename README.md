# Dotfiles

It became time that I took my configurations seriously. So here they are! Most of the motions configured are vim like. Currently using fedora 38 for this.

## Contents
- [i3](https://github.com/i3/i3)
- [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)
- [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli)
- [feh](https://github.com/derf/feh)
- [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

## Installation
 
I manage these configuration using chezmoi!

``` bash
chezmoi init git@github.com:theintegrative/dotfiles.git
```
